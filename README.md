University Management System:

I designed a system that represents the organizational structure of a university.
Hereâ€™s what I implemented:

The university has classrooms, work offices, and departments.
Each department has its own offices.
The university employs staff members, who can be either professors or administrative personnel.
Every staff member works in an office.

I created a Class Diagram to represent this system.

Note: There was no need to specify the attributes or behaviors of the classes.
